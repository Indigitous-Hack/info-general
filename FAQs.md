# Your field guide to getting involved in #hack weekend

## How do I...

### Register

Sign up for hack [here](https://indigitous.org/location/virtual/#hack-register)! Registration takes just a minute (you can even use Facebook or Github to make it superfast!)

### Join or submit a project

If you want to join up and work on one of our [14 global projects](https://indigitous.org/hack/challenges), you need to be on [our Slack team](http://kingdombuilders.io/) so that you can meet up with and collaborate with other hackers like you from around the world! 

Projects are coordinated in channels, so that's where you'll want to be in order to join a team. That's all there is to it. 
 - Register on Indigitous
 - Join slack
 - Meet people, hack, have fun!
 
### Talk to everyone

One word: [Slack](http://kingdombuilders.io)

Everything is going to be coordinated over one of the most awesome chat platforms ever built.

### Find a mentor or someone to help

We have a Slack channel just for that purpose! If you need help (or need help finding help), just join the `#mentor` channel and ask. We have four dozen friendly mentors ready and waiting to help.

### Post on ${twitter, facebook, ...}

*drumroll please* We're using two hashtags: `#hack` and `#hack4missions`. On top of that, you can tweet to or mention `@indigitous` on Twitter.

### Coordinate work across 28 cities and a whole heap of timezones

Slack! And caffeine! And really awesome mentors and challenge leads!
